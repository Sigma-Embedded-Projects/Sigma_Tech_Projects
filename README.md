## List of Projects
### Project 1 : UART_Xmodem_Bootloader

This project is a bootloader for the STM32L5 microcontroller series (You can customize it for your specific STM32). It allows uploading a .bin file to the microcontroller via UART using the Xmodem protocol.

#### Features
- UART Communication: Utilizes UART for serial communication between the host PC and the STM32L5.
- Xmodem Protocol: Implements the Xmodem protocol for reliable file transfer.

#### Getting Started
- Hardware Setup: Connect the STM32L5 to a PC using a UART interface (STlink).
- Software Setup: Clone this repository and open it in your preferred IDE (STM32CubeIDE).
- Upload Process: Use the provided scripts or tools (Tera Term) to upload the .bin file via UART.

#### Usage
1. Prepare the .bin File: Ensure your firmware is compiled into a .bin file.
2. Run the Bootloader: Start the bootloader on the STM32L5.
3. Upload the File: Use the Xmodem protocol to upload the .bin file from your PC to the STM32L5.


Happy coding! ðŸš€
